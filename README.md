# Mixture of Probabilistic PCA in Python3 (ongoing)
Implementation of the paper :  <a href="http://www.miketipping.com/papers/met-mppca.pdf"> Michael E. Tipping and Christopher M. Bishop, Mixtures of Probabilistic
Principal Component Analysers</a>


# Implementation:
*This implementation was based at a first stage on Michel Blancard's repo https://github.com/michelbl/MPPCA
*Added the base Probabilistic PCA model with classic methods : fit, transform, adn score
*For a MPPCA, Blancard's repo can also be used which provides also a python notebook to visualize results.
